# MC-TACO 🌮
Dataset and code for “Going on a vacation” takes longer than “Going for a walk”: A Study of Temporal Commonsense Understanding EMNLP 2019. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03065))

## Dataset
We provide the dev/test split as specified in the paper, along with a detailed readme.txt file under `dataset/`

## Leaderboard 
See the details and instructions at:

## Experiments (WIP)
At this point, we provide the outputs of the ESIM/BERT baselines. 

To run BERT baseline: 

First install required packages with: 
```bash 
pip install -r experiments/bert/requirements.txt
```

Your the following command to reproduce BERT predictions under `./bert_output`: 
```bash
sh experiments/bert/run_bert_baseline.sh
```
Evaluate the predictions with which you can further evaluate with the following command: 

```bash 
python ../evaluator/evaluator.py eval --test_file data/test_9442.tsv --prediction_file bert_output/eval_outputs.txt
```

ESIM baseline: Releasing soon after some polish
